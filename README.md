## BACKGROUND: 
Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a chronic disease affecting 12 million Americans, in which plaque build-up forms in the femoral, popliteal, tibial, or peroneal arteries. The obstruction causes claudication and weakness in the legs. Recent trends have shown an increase in the usage of endovascular interventions as second-line therapy over pharmacologic treatments. As surgical procedures introduce safety risks, a comparative effectiveness study of second-line endovascular interventions against pharmacologic treatments was executed to determine the risk of requiring limb amputation or arterial bypass (primary endpoint) and the risk of experiencing serious cardiovascular, ischemic, and mortality-related events (safety endpoint).

## METHODS: 
Administrative claims data sets were utilized to identify patients with PAD who had undergone a first-line therapy but required a second-line therapy of either cilostazol, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with stent, or PTA with atherectomy. Due to confounding of outcomes and treatment patterns among diabetic PAD patients, diabetic patients were restricted from the cohorts. Pairwise comparisons of the PTA-based treatment pathways were conducted against the cilostazol treatment pathway. Propensity-score matching was implemented to adjust for all known confounders; Cox proportional hazards models were generated to assess hazard ratios. Empirical calibration of the traditional p-value was executed to adjust for inherent systemic error in the data sets.

## RESULTS: 
PTA-based treatment pathways consistently had an elevated risk of requiring amputation or bypass compared to the cilostazol treatment pathway. PTA with stent (HR 1.92, 95% CI [1.07, 3.47], traditional p = 0.03, calibrated p = 0.049; HR 2.37, 95% CI [1.33, 4.31], traditional p = 0.004, calibrated p = 0.001) and PTA with atherectomy (HR 1.90, 95% CI [1.01, 3.75], traditional p = 0.054, calibrated p = 0.024) had statistically significant effects. No statistically significant effects were observed for the safety endpoint.

## CONCLUSIONS: 
Among second-line therapies, the risk of requiring amputation or bypass appeared to be elevated for patients undergoing endovascular interventions compared to patients beginning a course of cilostazol.
